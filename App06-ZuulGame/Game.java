/**
 *  This class is the main class of Hack-o-Mania, the re-developed edition
 *  of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "Hack-o-Mania" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around rooms and try to complete the mission.
 *  
 *  The goal of this game is to find and break into the server room
 *  and hack the files.
 *  
 *  For this, there are many items to pick up, and many doors to unlock.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method, or run the program.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
